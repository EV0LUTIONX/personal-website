<p>On the technical side, I’m a specialized generalist, always working between different areas and aiming to develop a holistic vision on what is involved into creating a successful tech product. Through my work I have involved a diverse variety of languages (from ANSI C to Go) and frameworks.</p>
<h1 id="experience">Experience</h1>
<p>I have over 10 years of experience leading a diverse portfolio of projects and working with teams of all sizes. I have architected, developed, and delivered digital products to help businesses improve people&rsquo;s lives by solving complex problems with simple solutions.</p>
