        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a SunPower system and 14, 400W solar panels installed on my house since May of 2019. It has always frustrated me that SunPower does not allow you to check the production and status of each panel out of the box. The app they give owners access to only displays the total amount of energy generated by the system over a given period of time. For most people this is probably fine and any additional displays would probably confuse the average owner.</description>
