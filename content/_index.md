# Who am I

I am an engineer by formation, curious and energetic - who applies technology to solve real-world problems. Personally, I’m a easy going, sociable, a fast-learner, curious and a natural leader. I do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams.

I am a deliberate jack of all trades, master of none. My profile is a hybrid of technical and managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams. I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve the customer experience in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like my positive and easy going, can-do attitude.

On the technical side, I’m a specialized generalist, always working between different areas and aiming to develop a holistic vision on what is involved into creating a successful tech product. Through my work I have involved a diverse variety of languages (from ANSI C to Go) and frameworks.

# Experience

I have over 10 years of experience leading a diverse portfolio of projects and working with teams of all sizes. I have architected, developed, and delivered digital products to help businesses improve people's lives by solving complex problems with simple solutions.
